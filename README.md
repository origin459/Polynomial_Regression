##Polynomial Regression from scratch##
This is a Polynomial Regression model that has a single feature and single target variable. 
The code is pretty straightforward.
To train the model on custom dataset, change the dataset location in the line #6. 
Next change the target column name [y] and the feature column name [x] to match your dataset.
Finally run the program to check how the model performs and plots a graph. 
This is a really basic model of polynomial regression built from scratch.
